### For Loop vs. While Loop â€“ Advantages and Disadvantages

### For Loop Advantages:

- Initialization, condition check, and update are in one line, which creates a clear and concise structure, making the code easy to read and maintain.
- Ideal for scenarios with a known number of iterations or when iterating with a fixed increment.
### For Loop Disadvantages:

- Less flexible for cases where the number of iterations is unknown or when complex conditions need to be managed.
### While Loop Advantages:

- Suitable for situations where the number of iterations is unknown, or continuation depends on dynamic run-time conditions.
- Offers greater flexibility since initialization and update statements can be placed either inside or outside the loop body.
### While Loop Disadvantages:

- Requires separate initialization and update statements, which might lead to errors like infinite loops if not handled properly.
- The structure may become less clear when dealing with intricate conditions, potentially reducing readability.
