Indicate whether the following statement declares or defines something.
(a)`extern int ix=1024;`
(b)`int iy;`
(c)`extern int iz;`
# Declaration vs Definition in C++

For these statements, I'll analyze whether they're declarations, definitions, or both:

## (a) `extern int ix=1024;`

**Definition** (not just a declaration)

The `extern` keyword normally indicates a declaration without definition, but providing an initializer (`=1024`) overrides the `extern` keyword and makes this a definition. This is actually a contradiction in terms - you're saying "this variable is defined elsewhere" while simultaneously defining it.

## (b) `int iy;`

**Definition**

This is a simple variable declaration with no `extern` keyword. In C++, all variable declarations without the `extern` keyword are also definitions. This statement both declares and defines the variable `iy`.

## (c) `extern int iz;`

**Declaration only** (not a definition)

This statement uses the `extern` keyword without an initializer. It tells the compiler that the variable `iz` exists and is defined elsewhere (in another translation unit or later in the same file). This is a pure declaration.
