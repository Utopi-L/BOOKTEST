**Choice of Data Types for Mortgage Calculations**

- **Interest Rate:**  
  Use a **double**. Interest rates are fractional values (e.g., 0.045 for 4.5%) and require sufficient precision.

- **Principal (Loan Amount):**  
  In many cases, the principal is a large whole number. You may use an unsigned large integer (such as **unsigned long long**) if you store the value in whole units (like dollars). However, if you need to account for cents, using a **double** is commonâ€”keeping in mind the potential pitfalls of floating-point arithmetic in money calculations.

- **Payments (Periodic Installments):**  
  Use a **double**. Since payments are typically fractional amounts (with decimals), a double provides the required precision.

These suggestions work well for basic mortgage computations. For financial applications that demand exact rounding (especially at the cents level), consider fixed-point arithmetic or specialized money libraries.
