What is the initial value of the following variables?
```cpp
std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
    int local_int;
    std::string local_str;
}
```
# Initial Values of Variables in C++

The initial values of these variables are determined by C++ initialization rules, which vary based on scope and type:

## Global Variables
- `std::string global_str;` - **Initial value:** Empty string `""`
  - Global variables of class types are initialized by their default constructors
  - The `std::string` default constructor creates an empty string

- `int global_int;` - **Initial value:** `0`
  - Global variables of built-in types are zero-initialized automatically

## Local Variables
- `int local_int;` - **Initial value:** Undefined (uninitialized)
  - Local variables of built-in types are not automatically initialized
  - Using this variable without first assigning a value causes undefined behavior

- `std::string local_str;` - **Initial value:** Empty string `""`
  - Local variables of class types are still initialized by their default constructors
  - The `std::string` default constructor creates an empty string

This difference in initialization behavior between global and local variables, and between built-in and class types, is an important aspect of C++ that developers need to understand.
