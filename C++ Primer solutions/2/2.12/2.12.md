# Analysis of C++ Identifier Legality

## (a) `int double=3.14;`
**ILLEGAL**
- `double` is a reserved keyword in C++ (a built-in type)
- Reserved keywords cannot be used as identifiers


## (b) `int _;`
**LEGAL**
- A single underscore is a valid identifier in C++
- Note: While legal, using `_` alone as a variable name is discouraged as it's not descriptive and could be confusing

## (c) `int catch-22;`
**ILLEGAL**
- Hyphens (`-`) are not allowed in C++ identifiers
- Only letters, digits, and underscores are permitted in identifiers
- `catch` is also a reserved keyword in C++

## (d) `int 1_or_2=1;`
**ILLEGAL**
- Variable names cannot begin with a digit
- Identifiers must begin with a letter or underscore

## (e) `double Double=3.14;`
**LEGAL**
- C++ is case-sensitive, so `Double` is different from the keyword `double`
- This is perfectly valid syntax
