Determine which of the definitions is illegal and explain reason.
```cpp
(a)int ival=1.01;
(b)int &rval1=1.01;
(c)int &rval2=ival;
(d)int &rval3;
```
# Analysis of C++ Reference Definitions

## (a) `int ival=1.01;`
**LEGAL**
- This initializes an int variable with a floating-point value
- The value 1.01 will be truncated to 1 (implicit conversion from double to int)
- While this may cause data loss, it's syntactically valid in C++

## (b) `int &rval1=1.01;`  
**ILLEGAL**
- References must be bound to objects (variables), not literals
- A non-const reference cannot be bound to a temporary value (which would be created by converting 1.01 to int)
- Additionally, there's a type mismatch (trying to bind an int reference to a double literal)

## (c) `int &rval2=ival;`
**LEGAL**
- This correctly creates a reference to an existing int variable (ival)
- The reference and the referenced object have matching types

## (d) `int &rval3;`
**ILLEGAL**
- References must be initialized at the time of declaration
- Unlike regular variables, references cannot be declared first and initialized later
- This is because references are not objects themselves but aliases for existing objects
