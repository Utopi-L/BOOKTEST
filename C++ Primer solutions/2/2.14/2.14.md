Determine if the following program is legal,if it is legal,what the output will be?
```cpp
int i=100,sum=0;
for (int i=0;i!=10;++i)
    sum+=i;
std::cout<<i<<" "<<sum<<std::endl;
```
And the output would be:
```
100 45
```

Explanation:
- The global variable `i` is initialized to 100
- The loop declares a new local variable `i` that shadows the global one within the loop scope
- This local `i` iterates from 0 to 9, and the values are added to `sum` (0+1+2+...+9 = 45)
- After the loop, `i` refers to the global variable again (with value 100)
- Therefore, the program prints `100 45`
